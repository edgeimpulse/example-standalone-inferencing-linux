The `libei_debug.a` file was built from: https://github.com/edgeimpulse/TensorRT/tree/libeitrt - build using:

```
$ sh docker/build.sh --file docker/ubuntu-cross-aarch64.Dockerfile --tag tensorrt --cuda 10.2
```

You can find the library in `/workspace/TensorRT/build/out/libei_debug.a` in the container.

The other libraries were pulled from a Jetson Nano directly.
